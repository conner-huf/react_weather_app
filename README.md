# Weather App

This project was built using React. I built this project to practice making a UI and interfacing with an API. This application uses the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/) to search the current weather for a given city.
This is the screen on loading the application:
---
![on_load](https://github.com/conner-huf/react_weather_app/assets/126115012/c3a6ea9f-bd49-42b3-8352-b9ff47a8c402)
The user can input a city and the application will call the API and populate the weather data into the page.

![on_successful_search](https://github.com/conner-huf/react_weather_app/assets/126115012/9473d2ec-2190-4b34-8c8e-61a8b483a05a)
If the user inputs an unrecognized city, the application will display "Location not found".
